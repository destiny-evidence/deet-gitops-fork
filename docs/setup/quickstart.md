# deet tutorial

This guide will help you to run first data extraction experiments using either the cli or python

## Setting up a project

A `DeetProject` is a workspace for a data extraction task for a specific dataset.
Each project should have its own directory on your machine.
This is where we will store configuration options and the results of your data extraction experiments.

### Initialising

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- **CLI**

    ---

    To set up a project using the CLI, run `deet project init` from the directory
    where you would like to store your project.
    Alternatively, you can run `deet project new` to create a project in a new directory.
    This will interactively collect the information required to set your project up,
    and also prompt you to enter credentials for making API calls to LLMs.

    ```sh
    mkdir new-project
    cd new-project
    deet project init
    ```

    ??? note "Non-interactive project creation"
        If you wish to create a project without the interactive wizard, you can enter
        project data as command line arguments. Run `deet project init --help` for
        more details. If you do this, you will need to create a `.env` file yourself
        to store API credentials (see [settings](../reference/api.md#deet.settings))

- **Python**

    ---

    To set up a project in python, simply instantiate a DeetProject object,
    and then call `DeetProject.setup()`

    ```python
    from deet.data_models.project import DeetProject
    from deet.processors.converter_register import SupportedImportFormat
    from pathlib import Path

    project = DeetProject(
        name="my cool new project",
        gold_standard_data_path=Path("<path_to_your_data>"),
        gold_standard_data_format=SupportedImportFormat.EPPI_JSON, # Replace this if you are using another import format
        pdf_dir=Path("<path_to_your_pdf_dir>")
    )
    project.setup()
    ```

    You should create a `.env` file yourself to store necessary API keys (see [settings](../reference/api.md#deet.settings))

    ??? note "Importing CLI commands"
        All CLI commands are defined as python functions. This means that any CLI
        command can be run directly in python.
        ```python
        from deet.scripts.commands.project import init
        init()
        ```
        This is often the simplest way to use `deet` in python. However, the following
        examples show how commands can be run using the underlying library

### Linking documents to pdfs

If you want to extract data from the full texts of your documents, you will need to edit the file `link_map.csv` created in your project directory by setting up deet, to point each document to the file that contains its pdf. The name of the file should be entered in the `file_path` column.

On initialising a project, this columnn is pre-filled with plausible mappings, but you should check that these are correct
and add any missing paths yourself.

??? note "External and internal IDs"
    Note that `deet` uses the `document_id` field internally. Where imported documents have an id that is not compatible, this is preserved in `external_id`, and converted to a compatible `document_id`. Where external IDs are compatible, these fields will be identical.

{{ read_csv('examples/quickstart/link_map.csv') }}

Once you are happy with this file, you can link the documents

- **CLI**

    ---

    In the CLI, you can do this by running

    ```sh
    deet project link
    ```

- **Python**

    ---

    To do this in python, use the DocumentReferenceLinker. You can also choose other strategies to link documents and pdfs (see [deet.processors.linker](../reference/api.md#deet.processors.linker))

    ```python
    from deet.processors.linker import DocumentReferenceLinker, LinkingStrategy
    from deet.data_models.project import DeetProject

    project = DeetProject.load()

    processed_annotation_data = project.process_data()

    linker = DocumentReferenceLinker(
        references=processed_annotation_data.documents,
        document_base_dir=project.pdf_dir,
        document_reference_mapping=project.link_map_path,
        linking_strategies=[LinkingStrategy.MAPPING_FILE],
    )
    linked_documents = linker.link_many_references_parsed_documents()
    ```

</div>

## Extracting data

### Writing and editing prompts

Setting up a project creates a file called `prompts/prompt_definitions.csv` with a row for each of the attributes you can extract from your data.
Edit this file, creating a prompt in the `prompt` column. This can contain any text, including commas.
Leave the `prompt` column blank for any attribute you do not wish to extract.
You can also edit the `output_data_type` column ([more info](../concepts/data-extraction.md#attributes)) if the automatically parsed data type is incorrect.

{{ read_csv('examples/quickstart/prompts/prompt_definitions.csv') }}

### Running an extraction experiment

Now that you've defined your prompts, you are ready to extract data from your documents.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- **CLI**

    ---

    In the CLI, you can do this by running

    ```sh
    deet experiments evaluate
    ```

    This will take you through an interactive wizard where you can select configuration
    options for your project.

    If you wish to skip the interactive wizard, simply pass a path to a configuration file
    to the `--config-path` argument.

    Running `deet experiments evaluate` will create a folder in your project's
    `data-extraction-experiments` directory, run the data extraction pipeline,
    and save the results of that experiment to the newly created folder.
    It will also save a snapshot of the prompts you used, as well as the config you used,
    making it easy to reproduce your experiments.
    If you wish to use prompts from a different location than the default location
    for your project, you can run an experiment with the `--prompt-csv-path` option, e.g.

    ```sh
    deet experiments evaluate --prompt-csv-path my-custom-prompts.csv
    ```

- **Python**

    ---

    To do this in python, use the LLMDataExtractor.
    You can use a DataExtractionConfig object to set configuration options

    ```python
    from deet.extractors.llm_data_extractor import LLMDataExtractor, DataExtractionConfig
    from deet.data_models.enums import CustomPromptPopulationMethod
    from deet.extractors.cli_helpers import (
        init_extraction_run,
        load_config_from_context,
        prepare_documents,
    )
    from deet.data_models.project import DeetProject

    project = DeetProject.load()

    config = DataExtractionConfig(
        # configure options here, or leave blank to use defaults
    )
    data_extractor = LLMDataExtractor(config=config)


    processed_annotation_data = project.process_data()

    # Populate your custom prompts
    processed_annotation_data.populate_custom_prompts(
        method=CustomPromptPopulationMethod.FILE,
        filepath=project.prompt_csv_path
    )

    documents = prepare_documents(
        processed_annotation_data.documents,
        config,
        linked_document_path=project.linked_documents_path,
        pdf_dir=project.pdf_dir,
        link_map_path=project.link_map_path,
    )

    run_output = data_extractor.extract_from_documents(
        attributes=processed_annotation_data.attributes,
        documents=documents,
        context_type=data_extractor.config.default_context_type,
        output_file=experiment_artefacts.llm_annotations,
        show_progress=True,
    )

    ```
